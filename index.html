                <h2>Rules</h2>
                <p>This game is for a single player only. You will see a question which you should answer by clicking on a character picture. Each correctly answered question will get you 10 points, an incorrect answer will result in GAME OVER. If Joey reaches his pizza and you didn't manage to answer correctly, this as well will result in GAME OVER. You win the game once you have correctly answered 5 questions in a row. Good luck!</p>
